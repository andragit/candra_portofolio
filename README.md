# Bike Sales Anlaysis
[Gituhub](https://github.com/andragit/BikeMarketAnalyze)

I utilized Excel to create a portfolio that incorporates data-driven decision-making. The portfolio involved analyzing bicycle sales data from a dataset, where I began by cleaning and standardizing column names, removing duplicates, and creating age brackets. Next, I generated pivot tables and graphs to summarize earnings by gender, sales by distance, and top 5 sales by age group. Lastly, I developed interactive dashboards that provide valuable insights to assist businesses in making informed, data-driven decisions.
